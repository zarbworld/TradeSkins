        <h1 Style="color:white">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h style="color:white">This page serves the purpose of clarifying the purpose of this website and to cover commonly asked questions.</h>
        <hr class="line2">
        <br>
        <h2 style="color:#eda42f">Why does this website exist?</h2>
        <h style="color:white">This website first started as an answer to an age old question. "Can you go from nothing to a knife?" The answer to this question is yes, but it is not nearly as spectacular as it used to be. With how competitive trading has become, especially with traders that have $100,000+ inventories, the only way to go from nothing to a knife is to either get extremely lucky from drops in game, or to go to the many external sites that are available. That is where this site comes in. We have personal experience with the grind to get CS:GO skins using these sites, and so we found it may be helpful to list the sites that have helped us build our inventories. Otherwise, this is just another referral site that lists helpful sites for your CS:GO trading endeavours.</h>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 style="color:#eda42f">How does this site make money?</h2>
        <h style="color:white">Considering CS:GO's troubled past with gambling sites, we believe it is only fair to be completely transparent about how this site stays running, and if we make any money from it. To be clear, <mark class="color">this website is meant to generate profit.</mark> For now, the only way we are capitalizing off of this site is through referral/affiliate links. These links are embedded in every "vist site" button. Not every single button has a referral link embedded within them, as some sites don't offer affiliate programs. As users trade, deposit, or earn on any of these sites, we get a small cut from the website we are referring. This is a non-intrusive way for us to list sites that may be helpful for our users, while also being able to support the development and maintenance of this site.</h>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 style="color:#eda42f">Why doesn't this site feature gambling sites?</h2>
        <h style="color:white">At the conception of this site, we did feature gambling sites since many of them provide free daily cases. Considering this is a referral site, it was justified to feature any site related to CS:GO, including all gambling sites. The issue is that I, the creator of this site, believe gambling sites to be harmful to this community and no longer wish to promote them. There are plenty of stories in the community surrounding the topic of gambling addiction and how it has greatly impacted their lives in a negative way. When you consider the fact that most of these stories take place during a time when the individual is underaged, you start to get the picture. I want my contribution to the community to be positive, especially since the community has already given me so much.</h>
